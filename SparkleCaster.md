> At the moment, the project is in it's infancy, and there are many bugs and unfinished portions.
You are welcome to modify the code and add features if you wish, but please keep it in line with the purpose of this application.
If you have any suggestions or fixes, please be my guest. :-) I am using this project to brush-up on my Cocoa/Objective-C, and could do with any advice that you have.
