#summary ESSTimeTrialClass documentation

= ESSTimeTrialClass - easily implement a time limit into your app =

This will terminate the application once a certain date has been reached (or terminate the app immediately if the date has been passed before starting the app).

==timeTrialWithEndDate:endMessage:==
{{{
+ (ESSTimeTrialClass *)timeTrialWithEndDate:(NSDate *)aDate endMessage:(NSString *)string;
}}}

Will return an ESSTimeTrialClass object, starting a timer with the endDate.

==initWithEndDate:endMessage:==
{{{
- (id)initWithEndDate:(NSDate *)aDate endMessage:(NSString *)string;
}}}

Will return an ESSTimeTrialClass object and will start a timer with the endDate.

==setEndDate:==
{{{
- (void)setEndDate:(NSDate *)aDate;
}}}

When "init"ed normally, use this to set an enddate. No timer is started (see startTimer/endTimer).

==setEndMessage:==
{{{
- (void)setEndMessage:(NSString *)string;
}}}

When "init"ed normally, use this to set an endmessage.

==startTimer==
{{{
- (void)startTimer;
}}}

When "init"ed normally, use this to start the timer after you set the endDate (setEndDate:) and endMessage (setEndMessage:).

==endTimer==
{{{
- (void)endTimer;
}}}

Use this to stop the timer (maybe useful when the user wants to register with a serial or something)
